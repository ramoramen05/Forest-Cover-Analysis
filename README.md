# Forest-Cover-Analysis
This project addresses one of the key factors contributing to adverse climate change in Pakistan: deforestation. It analyzes the deforestation and forest growth patterns by using the Global Forest Change (GFC) dataset and the Large Scale International Boundary (LSIB) dataset. It is scripted on Google Earth Engine using Javascript. 

It creates four main layers: 
1. Gain
2. Loss
3. Forest Cover
4. Forest Cover Masked
5. Forest Cover Percent
6. Forest Cover Pallete
7. Forest Cover, Loss, Gain
8. Green
9. False Color
10. Layer 1

Interpretation of Map colors:
1. Green: Forest areas with healthy vegetation
2. Red: Tree loss (deforestation or burnt areas)
3. Blue or Cyan: Areas with forest gain 
4. Black/Gray: Areas with no forest cover

How to run the code:

1. Copy the link
2. Paste into your google earth engine script editor
3. Adjust the layers for your area of interest
